# SR_stats_lightning

Code and data for the article ***Statistical footprint of lightning activity on the Schumann resonance*** implemented using the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/).

### Contents

* **[SR_stats_lightning.r](SR_stats_lightning.r):** Functions used by the analysis.

* **[S_EW_10min.mat](S_EW_10min.mat):** statistical analysis of Schumann Resonances Data from the EW channel, segments of 10 minutes duration with an overlap of 9 minutes.

* **[S_NS_10min.mat](S_NS_10min.mat):** statistical analysis of Schumann Resonances Data from the NS channel, segments of 10 minutes duration with an overlap of 9 minutes.

* **[S_EW_1min.mat](S_EW_1min.mat):** statistical analysis of Schumann Resonances Data from the EW channel, segments of 1 minute duration with no overlap.

* **[S_NS_1min.mat](S_NS_1min.mat):** statistical analysis of Schumann Resonances Data from the NS channel, segments of 1 minute duration with no overlap.
