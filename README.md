* **[S_EW_10min.mat](S_EW_10min.mat):** statistical analysis of Schumann Resonances Data from the EW channel, segments of 10 minutes duration with an overlap of 9 minutes.

* **[S_NS_10min.mat](S_NS_10min.mat):** statistical analysis of Schumann Resonances Data from the NS channel, segments of 10 minutes duration with an overlap of 9 minutes.

* **[S_EW_1min.mat](S_EW_1min.mat):** statistical analysis of Schumann Resonances Data from the EW channel, segments of 1 minute duration with no overlap.

* **[S_NS_1min.mat](S_NS_1min.mat):** statistical analysis of Schumann Resonances Data from the NS channel, segments of 1 minute duration with no overlap.
